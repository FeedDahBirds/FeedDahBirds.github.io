Always challenge yourself to be ready for the road ahead.
I've begun a strict educational-workout to try and cover the areas I feel weak and wouldn't like to be reasons I fail the course. 
8 more days til' corse start!

## Getting in PyShape
Python is the premier language used for DL/DS/AI and most other interesting things in the world today. I sadly, have always been more fond of Javascript and other languages so my Python isn't THAT strong going into this.

While for the most part, all c inspired languages are equivelent; it's more about knowing the quality of life things that make it easier to do things in less lines of code. For example, say I had a list of things...

```
    let list = ['Apples', 'Bananas', 'Oranges']
```
And I want to square the length of each string or something weird. In Javascript, I can make it a one-liner.

```js
    let squaredNameLengths = list.map((word)=> word.length * word.length);
    //[36, 49, 49]
```

It may seem a bit trivial to some people, but knowing how easy some things can be in a certain language can make working on similar problems in different languages more of a challange if you aren't as familiar with the 'easy-way' of doing it.

TLDR;

Anyway, this is all just to say I've signed-on as a CodeWarrior on CodeWars and it's been a blast!

CodeWars was really helpful for me back in the day when I was learning Javascript, it helped me easily get to the point where I learned the easy of doing things in Javascript.

To show off...

```python
    name_list = ['Apples', 'Bananas', 'Oranges']
    squared_lengths = map(lambda x: len(x) * len(x), name_list)
    #[36, 49, 49]
```

Currently a 5 kyu after spending an hour or two the last few days learning some of the tricks, the badge above should automatically change as I progress further so hopefully those reading this in the future will see me as a 1 kyu!

## Youtube.Youtube.Youtube.

To state something that's probably been stated millions of times at this point, you can learn almost anything on the internet. Youtube is particularly useful for this.

One of the better channels I've found so far is..
[Siraj Raval's Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWN3xxRkmTPmbKwht9FuE5A "Siraj Raval")
He does have an advantage though, as he did work with Udacity to make them specifically for the Deep Learning Nanodegree program.

Other things I've seen that felt helpful:
* [Ian Goodfellow Lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vi7lACKOUao)
* [3Blue1Brown's But What *is* a Neural Network?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aircAruvnKk)

You can read through a book Ian co-authored at [here](http://www.deeplearningbook.org/ "Deep Learning Book Link")
I haven't had the time yet, but fully intend to try and use this alongside the course.

## Other Things?

Trying to think of some fun projects that I can do outside of the coursework to show off my skills and hopefully build something interesting. Was thinking about training a model to automate Gen1 Pokemon battles or unsupervised learning to have something can gradually understand what to do in a pokemon battle. Or maybe something involving Overwatch hero counters?

Not too sure on anything yet, but I'll find something I'm sure.
