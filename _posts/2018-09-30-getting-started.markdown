## The Journey Begins
> "The pursuit of knowledge is more valuable than its possession.
# - Albert Einstein

Udacity is calling my name! I've signed-up for the Deep Learning Nanodegree program to use it as a primer to later take the Natural Language Processing Nanodegree progam in order to further my knowledge and **hopefully** my career.

## Long Term Plan
![alt text][plan]

I love being a developer and I love to learn and apply new things to my work. However, my current working situation doesn't seem to meet me eye-to-eye on these things. I get to develop, but it's not exactly software that I personally care for or believe in. 

My hope is to use what I learn to create my own business consulting and building applications using Natural Language Processing, or change my place of employment to better match my ambition.

## Post-A-Week Challenge
As part of my commitment to this I would like to keep everyone up to date and learning along side me. I will be posting once a week about things I've learned, fun projects and whatever I'm working on towards my ultimage goal of completing both the Deep Learning and NLP nanodegree programs. If we get lucky, I may start up a bit of a Youtube show-and-tell in order to practice talking about course topics and give some video editing an honest-shot.
